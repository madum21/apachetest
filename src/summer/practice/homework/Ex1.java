	 * 
	 * TODO
	 * 1. Create a new workbook where, on the first row, will be the header of the table, having as column headers: Name, Age and Sex
	 * Generate at least 10 entries in the table, the age must be between 18 and 60; for the other attributes it's up to you
	 * to decide how to generate them
	 * 
	 * a) Highlight the rows with oldest and youngest persons (oldest and youngest for both M/F). If there are two persons with
	 * the same age and both of them are youngest/oldest, choose the entry which you will highlight based on the lexicographical order
	 * (for instance, for Miruna & Maria, we will choose Maria because on the second position of the name, we have "i" & "a" and the
	 * lexical order is "a",...,"i",...)
	 * 
	 * b) In the same workbook create another 2 sheets. The first one will contain men and the second one female. These two sheets
	 *  will contain the data filtered from the first sheet and we won't have a column for sex. Compute the age average for both
	 *  sheets (using excel formula).
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * OPTIONAL:
	 * 
	 * c) Find a library for generating names and used it when you create the first sheet (e.g. there could be some libraries that
	 * generate random names, it should a jar, if not, you can try to create one by yourself, it doesn't matter if the names are real
	 * or not, but to be close)
	 * 
	 * d) Read about Apache CSV and use it for reading the data that you put on the first sheet. CSV (aka Comma Separated Values) 
	 * files can be opened via Excel, Notepad, etc and can have headers and other stuffs. Create this file manually or with Apache CSV
	 * and after that, based on this file, you will generate the first sheet.
	 * 
	 * e) Use a JSON library for creating a JSON object and you will read data from that object and put it on the first sheet. Either
	 * you create that JSON object on a web application, download that file and use it in your application or use directly a a library
	 * in Java for creating that object. For both cases, you need a library (json-YYYYMMDD.jar should do the trick)
