	 * TODO
	 * Considering the table created in Ex1 - point a) - you have the possibility either to use that one or to create another one.
	 * Based on that table you should create a Bar Chart with the data from it and put the Chart in the same Excel file.
	 * 
	 * HINTS:
	 * You can use the library called JFreeChart for creating this chart. It should be in /lib folder
	 * 
	 * For doing this, you can find below some useful classes in order to achieve this:
	 *     - Classes from JFreeChart library
	 *     		ChartFactory;
				ChartUtilities;
				JFreeChart;
				PlotOrientation;
				DefaultCategoryDataset;
	 *
	 *	   - Classes from Apache POI library
	 *			ClientAnchor;
				Drawing;
				Picture;
				XSSFClientAnchor;
				HSSFClientAnchor;
	 * 
	 * This is just a proposal, you can use other libraries to do this 
	 *
