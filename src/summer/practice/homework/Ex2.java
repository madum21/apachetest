	 * Feel free to implement any application that could be useful for you and uses Excel files. In the last session we had a
	 * question about a school timetable. If you have one in Excel, you can try to create a new sheet where you'll have:
	 * 
	 * a) the lowest number of days I have to go to college and to attend all subjects
	 * 
	 * b) the lowest number of days I have to go to college and to attend all laboratories and seminars
	 * 
	 * c) create a new sheet with the most efficient timetable for you (this means that you minimise the time spent between subjects)
	 * 
	 *  All these should be computed/created based on what you read from your timetable. 
	 *  
	 *  This was just an idea, you can do whatever you want.
